%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% README

plot_omega is used to plot eigenvalues of spatial discretizations \omega. 
This plot will have 3 branches of waves just like in TW2005. 

If custom number of vertical levels is used (not 20), then first one needs to 
run findHommeDispersion to find solutions m of eqn tan(m*D)=2*m/(B-A) .
These m values need to be recorded in script kvals_load .
Script findHommeDispersion also solves for analytical values \omega for 3 branches of waves 
(by solving quintic eqn numerically). 
One can tune that script for analytical branches as solutions for \omega 
depend on initial interval (the script is tuned for 20 levels, not 72 or 128).

plot_stability plots (dx,dt) white-blue stability plot for a particular 
IMEX scheme. By default for horizontal wavenumber k it takes 2dx wave
and it uses homme conventions to denote hor. resolutions.

IMEX methods and auxiliary functions are in folder IMEXfunctions.

dispersion_dissipation4 is used to plot amplification factors and numerical
\omega for IMEX method based on spatial discretizetion as in plot_omega. 
Before using dispersion_dissipation3, one needs to save spatial discretization
(by running plot_omega) for desired vertical levels. 
plot_omega, dispersion_dissipation, and save_5wave... use original value 
of horizontal wavenumber k, as in TW2005
(but this can be changed).

lock_plotting_courant_axes plots stability diagram using acoustics-gravity system as
in Lock2014 with ~Courant numbers for axes.

lock_plotting_new plots stability diagram using acoustics-gravity system as
in Lock2014 with dx,dt for axes.

nlev_convergence plots stability diagrams for varying dz.
